Wavefront Path Tracer

This is where I will take my cpu and gpu versions of my path tracer
and convert them to wavefront tracers.

At this starting point, I have developed a GPU and CPU version of a ray tracer
based on Peter Shirley's excellent first book (though I implemented a BVH tree
from book 2).

Future updates:
- add other geometric shapes
- add textures
- start loading in obj files for cooler scenes to render
- start increasing complexity by implementing some features from Physically Based Rendering
